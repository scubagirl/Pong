Pong
====

This was a group project designed for a programming class using micro-controllers. It will only work with an ArduinoUno
with an attached EPSON ColorShield LCD screen. 

My contributions included:
  1. Making the paddle and ball code work together
  2. Writing most of the main pong code
  3. Adding color into the the program
  
This code uses examples from other programmers inside of the paddle and ball code portions of the project.
